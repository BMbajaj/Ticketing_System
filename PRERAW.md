## Executive Summary

This document outlines a modern, cloud-native ticketing system built using FastAPI, AWS Lambda, and MongoDB. The solution provides a scalable, cost-efficient platform for managing support requests with minimal operational overhead. The serverless architecture eliminates infrastructure management while providing on-demand scaling capabilities to meet variable workloads.

## System Architecture

The ticketing system employs a serverless microservices architecture with these primary components:

```

### API Endpoints

#### Authentication
- `POST /auth/login` - Authenticate user and issue JWT token
- `POST /auth/register` - Register new user account
- `GET /auth/me` - Get current user profile

#### Tickets
- `GET /tickets` - List tickets with filtering options
- `POST /tickets` - Create new ticket
- `GET /tickets/{id}` - Retrieve specific ticket
- `PUT /tickets/{id}` - Update ticket information
- `POST /tickets/{id}/comments` - Add comment to ticket
- `GET /tickets/stats` - Get ticket statistics

#### Users
- `GET /users` - List users (admin only)
- `GET /users/{id}` - Get user details
- `PUT /users/{id}` - Update user information
- `DELETE /users/{id}` - Deactivate user account

### Data Models

#### Ticket
```python
class Ticket:
    id: str                    # Unique identifier
    title: str                 # Short description
    description: str           # Detailed problem description
    status: TicketStatus       # Current state (enum)
    priority: TicketPriority   # Importance level (enum)
    category: str              # Issue classification
    created_by: str            # User who created the ticket
    created_at: datetime       # Creation timestamp
    updated_at: datetime       # Last update timestamp
    assigned_to: Optional[str] # Support agent assigned
    comments: List[Comment]    # Communication thread
```

#### User
```python
class User:
    id: str                    # Unique identifier
    email: EmailStr            # User email (unique)
    name: str                  # Full name
    hashed_password: str       # Securely stored password
    role: UserRole             # User, Agent, or Admin
    created_at: datetime       # Account creation timestamp
```

## Security Model

### Authentication
- JWT (JSON Web Token) based authentication
- Tokens include user identity and role information
- Short-lived tokens with configurable expiration
- Token blacklisting for critical security events

### Authorization
- Role-based access control for all endpoints
- Permission verification middleware
- Data access filtering based on user role
- Input validation on all API endpoints

### Infrastructure Security
- API Gateway request throttling
- Lambda execution isolation
- MongoDB connection string encryption
- Secrets management for sensitive values

## Deployment Strategy

### Infrastructure as Code
- AWS resources defined in `serverless.yml`
- MongoDB Atlas provisioned via Terraform (optional)
- CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments

### Deployment Environments
- Development: For active feature development
- Staging: Pre-production testing environment
- Production: Live customer-facing environment

### Deployment Process
1. Code pushed to repository triggers CI pipeline
2. Unit and integration tests are executed
3. Build process packages Lambda functions
4. Serverless Framework deploys to AWS
5. Post-deployment tests verify functionality

## Scalability Considerations

### Lambda Auto-Scaling
- Automatic scaling from 0 to thousands of instances
- Concurrent execution limits configurable based on demand
- Cold start optimization with provisioned concurrency

### Database Scaling
- MongoDB Atlas tier selection based on workload
- Automatic sharding for horizontal scaling
- Read replicas for improved query performance

### Performance Optimization
- Connection pooling for database operations
- Efficient query patterns with proper indexing
- Response caching for frequently accessed data
- Asynchronous processing for time-consuming operations

## Maintenance and Support
